Potential site Audience:

1. potential clients

need to see our work, the type of clients we work with, our own style, who we are as a design time (our humanness). Want to see who we are within the context of the industry. Want to see if we actually know what we're talking about or just put up fluff in our blog. They ultimately need to see how they can get in contact with us. Also connect via social media easily and see our interaction across our different clients.

2. people looking to learn something via the blog

Make sure we are building out useful information that helps the kind of people that would visit our website. Provide actionable content, not recycled filler that seems to be common on most agency blogs. Make sure it's consistent and current. Make it about them.

3. Media/PR people

Make sure contact info and our portfolio are impressive, in-line with our style and culture and most importantly easy to find.

4. Potential partners or new hires.

Make sure our work, style and culture is conveyed through the website to be able to speak to potential partners or people that want to work with us. Make a career page you don't have to hunt for. Bring our humanity and creativity to light and work throughout the whole website and the copy.

5. Current clients

Current clients may like to see new blog posts to learn something, or see their brand on a portfolio page or just get in contact with us if they need something and can't get in touch with one of us directly for some reason.

6. Competitors

They will probably look at our website seething with jealousy eventually. So don't give it all away on the surface but be humans and not overly competitive.
