I agree with what I read in the perceivable article, although it's not something I really thought of before I started this course. I think in the past it was a novelty to have text-only versions, or ways to make websites perceivable. But in today's age when nearly everything and everyone is online, it's only right  to make sure those with disabilities aren't left by the wayside. I'm confident assistive technologies will get better and make it easier to make websites more perceivable but as a developer, I think we need to do the best we can to make sure whatever we're creating is accessible to all.

In terms of how it will affect design or how I can make applications more perceivable I think it's important to distinguish content vs design. It's also important to have a text-only portion of every page. Also, always include a transcript and/or subtitles when working with video files.
