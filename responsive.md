Some key features and benefits of responsive design are as follows;
- easier and cheaper to maintain
- creating usable experiences (whereas if a desktop version of a flight booking widget on a smart phone is terribly frustrating and will lead to user drop-off)
- break points can be altered
- one css file where the browser selects the styling to be used
- RWD is somewhat 'future-proof'

Building a responsive design website is quicker and cheaper for businesses that have budget concerns. More people are likely to make purchases on websites than they are on native apps according to multiple sources.

Native apps have to be built in either ios or android (java) and that requires programmers who either know both languages, or two programmers which can be expensive. Also, depending on your target audience, it might be a waste to spend so much money building an android app when your audience mostly has iphones and vice versa. However some native app benefits include having access to many ios or android features like accelerometers, GPS, magnetometer and cameras just to name a few that are bit more complicated to include in a web app.

My opinion on responsive apps vs native apps?
It's entirely dependent on what I'm trying to make. Some things would probably work better as a native app and others would work better as a responsive app. I think if you're going to lean on content for the app or sell products, responsive is probably a better route.
